# Tana Paste examples for Raycast

Main repo: [tanainc/tana-paste-examples](https://github.com/tanainc/tana-paste-examples)

This repo is intended to show some examples on how to use Tana Paste
with [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). The examples use Raycast's
[script commands](https://www.raycast.com/blog/getting-started-with-script-commands)
to execute the scripts. 

## Raycast Setup

### Configure `tana-paste-examples` directory in Raycast

![prefs screenshot](media/raycast-prefs.png)

1. Open Raycast preferences (`Cmd-Space` followed by `Cmd-,`)
2. Open "Script Commands" preferences (Extensions->Scripts->Script Commands)
3. Click "Add Directories"
4. Select your `tana-paste-examples` directory

### Add Raycast comments to scripts

Once the directory is added, Raycast will automatically discover any commands
containing Raycast-specific comments. These comments act as instructions, which
tell Raycast the name of the script, the arguments, icons, etc.

See the scripts in this repo for examples on what the comment header looks like.

For example, see [github.mjs](github.mjs)

### Start using Raycast with Tana Paste scripts

#### RSS example

NYT example feed: https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml

Type `rss` to find the RSS command, and paste in an RSS feed URL:
![raycast rss](media/raycast-rss.png)

Output:
![raycast output](media/raycast-output.png)

Press `Cmd-Shift-C` to copy to clipboard

Open Tana and paste result!

## Example scripts that generate Tana Paste output

Tana Paste is a special text format that is parsed by Tana, and generates rich Tana structures when pasted normally. All text is preceded by `%%tana%%` to trigger this special functionality. More details about the format [in the help center](https://help.tana.inc/build-tutorials/tana-paste.html).

All these scripts are provided solely as examples/inspiration. Feel free to modify, or use as templates to explore other sources of data. If you have interesting improvements or new scripts, we welcome pull requests.

You can run these scripts normally to inspect the output, but we recommend piping to pbcopy on Mac or similar tools to put the text directly on the clipboard for use with Tana. These scripts an also be launched automatically by tools like Keyboard Maestro.
